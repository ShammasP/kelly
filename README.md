# Kelly — AI Scientist Chatbot (poet-scientist)

Live demo @ https://kenc7mx6auuwj6fjhacjyf.streamlit.app/

Kelly is an AI Scientist chatbot that answers every question as a poem in the voice of "Kelly, the great poet".

- Tone: skeptical, analytical, professional
- Each reply: questions broad claims, points out limitations, and gives practical evidence-based suggestions

Usage
------

Run a single question from the command line:

```powershell
python run_kelly.py "Will AI replace scientists?"
```

Or run tests:

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
```

Files
-----

- `kelly_bot.py` — core poem-generating function `respond(prompt)`
- `run_kelly.py` — small CLI wrapper
- `tests/test_kelly.py` — unit tests ensuring poem properties
- `requirements.txt` — minimal test dependency

Design notes
------------

Kelly's poem responses are generated by a deterministic template that keeps a skeptical and evidence-focused voice. It deliberately includes practical suggestions (evaluation, data checks, monitoring, and human oversight) rather than ungrounded optimism.
